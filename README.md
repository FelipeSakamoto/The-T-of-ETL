# The T of ETL

One of the phases of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) is to deal with the data for a clean and clear load. It is very common to have databases and datasets that are in trouble. Null data, dirty data and confusing data are examples of what can make information obfuscated. Therefore, transformation is an extremely important part.

This project consists only of exploring data transformation techniques and analytical power of information. For this, the Python programming language will be used, mainly with the Pandas library. The data was acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shashankshukla123123/linkedin-job-data), which is a LinkedIn dataset that has job data.
